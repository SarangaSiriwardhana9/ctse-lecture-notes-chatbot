 Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It involves requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Agile methodology is a popular software development approach focused on iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback.

DevOps is a combination of development and operations. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

Microservices architecture is a design approach where a large application is composed of small, loosely coupled services that communicate over APIs.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are current trends in software engineering that enable systems to learn and make decisions from data.

Cloud computing allows developers to deploy applications on remote servers, providing scalability and reliability.

Version control systems like Git help track changes in code and facilitate team collaboration.

Continuous integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository and automatically testing them.

Unit testing involves writing test cases for individual components to ensure they work as expected.

Software quality attributes include maintainability, scalability, reliability, and usability.
